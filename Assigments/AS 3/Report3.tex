\section{Overview}\label{overview}}

In this assignment, we're going to work through some applied issues
related to regression discontinuity designs. We'll cover the basics of
strict and fuzzy RD, and we'll work through standard specification
tests. We'll also introduce some more technical aspects of bin and
bandwidth selection.

Please ``submit'' your answers as a GitHub repository link on Canvas. In
this repo, please include a final document with your main answers and
analyses in a PDF. Be sure to include in your repository all of your
supporting code files. Practice writing good code and showing me only
what I would need to recreate your results.

The data for this assignment comes from the AEJ: Policy website, where
Keith Ericson's complete dataset is available. The data are available
\href{https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.6.1.38}{here}. I
will also upload the replication files to our class OneDrive folder.

\section{Questions}\label{questions}}

In your GitHub repository, please be sure to clearly address/answer the
following questions.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Recreate the table of descriptive statistics (Table 1) from
  @ericson2014.
\item
  Recreate Figure 3 from @ericson2014.
\item
  @calonico2015 discuss the appropriate partition size for binned
  scatterplots such as that in Figure 3 of Ericson (2014). More
  formally, denote by
  \(\mathcal{P}_{-,n} = \{ P_{-,j} : j=1, 2, ... J_{-, n} \}\) and
  \(\mathcal{P}_{+,n} = \{ P_{+,j} : j=1, 2, ... J_{+, n} \}\) the
  partitions of the support of the running variable \(x_{i}\) on the
  left and right (respectively) of the cutoff, \(\bar{x}\). \(P_{-, j}\)
  and \(P_{+, n}\) denote the actual supports for each \(j\) partition
  of size \(J_{-,n}\) and \(J_{+,n}\), such that
  \([x_{l}, \bar{x}) = \bigcup_{j=1}^{J_{-,n}} P_{-, j}\) and
  \((\bar{x}, x_{u}] = \bigcup_{j=1}^{J_{+,n}} P_{+, j}\). Individual
  bins are denoted by \(p_{-,j}\) and \(p_{+,j}\). With this notation in
  hand, we can write the partitions \(J_{-,n}\) and \(J_{+,n}\) with
  equally-spaced bins as
  \[p_{-,j}=x_{l} + j \times \frac{\bar{x} - x_{l}}{J_{-,n}},\] and
  \[p_{+,j} = \bar{x} + j \times \frac{x_{u} - \bar{x}}{J_{+,n}}.\]
  Recreate Figure 3 from Ericson (2014) using \(J_{-,n}=J_{+,n}=10\) and
  \(J_{-,n}=J_{+,n}=30\). Discuss your results and compare them to your
  figure in Part 2.
\item
  With the notation above, @calonico2015 derive the optimal number of
  partitions for an evenly-spaced (ES) RD plot. They show that
  \[J_{ES,-,n} = \left\lceil \frac{V_{-}}{\mathcal{V}_{ES,-}} \frac{n}{\text{log}(n)^{2}} \right\rceil\]
  and
  \[J_{ES,+,n} = \left\lceil \frac{V_{+}}{\mathcal{V}_{ES,+}} \frac{n}{\text{log}(n)^{2}} \right\rceil,\]
  where \(V_{-}\) and \(V_{+}\) denote the sample variance of the
  subsamples to the left and right of the cutoff and
  \(\mathcal{V}_{ES,.}\) is an integrated variance term derived in the
  paper. Use the \texttt{rdrobust} package in \texttt{R} (or
  \texttt{Stata} or \texttt{Python}) to find the optimal number of bins
  with an evenly-spaced binning strategy. Report this bin count and
  recreate your binned scatterplots from parts 2 and 3 based on the
  optimal bin number.
\item
  One key underlying assumption for RD design is that agents cannot
  precisely manipulate the running variable. While ``precisely'' is not
  very scientific, we can at least test for whether there appears to be
  a discrete jump in the running variable around the threshold. Evidence
  of such a jump may suggest that manipulation is present. Provide the
  results from the manipulation tests described in @cattaneo2018. This
  test can be implemented with the \texttt{rddensity} package in
  \texttt{R}, \texttt{Stata}, or \texttt{Python}.
\item
  Recreate Table 3 of @ericson2014 using the same bandwidth of \$4.00.
\item
  @calonico2020 show that pre-existing optimal bandwidth calculations
  (such as those used in @ericson2014) are invalid for appropriate
  inference. They propose an alternative method to derive minimal
  coverage error (CE)-optimal bandwidths. Re-estimate your RD results
  using the CE-optimal bandwidth (\texttt{rdrobust} will do this for
  you) and compare the bandwidth and RD estimates to that in Table 3 of
  @ericson2014.
\item
  Now let's extend the analysis in Section V of @ericson2014 using IV.
  Use the presence of Part D low-income subsidy as an IV for market
  share to examine the effect of market share in 2006 on future premium
  changes.
\item
  Discuss your findings and compare results from different binwidths and
  bandwidths. Compare your results in part 8 to the invest-then-harvest
  estimates from Table 4 in @ericson2014.
\item
  Reflect on this assignment. What did you find most challenging? What
  did you find most surprising?
